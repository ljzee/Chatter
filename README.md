# Chatter (Real-time chat application)

(React/Node/Express/MongoDB)

Chatter is a mobile friendly chat application. Users can create an account, add friends, and chat with them.

**My goals for the project:**

* Learn and develop an application using a JavaScript web-socket library (Socket.IO)
* Practice using React Hooks
